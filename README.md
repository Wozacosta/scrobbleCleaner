## scrobbleCleaner
Quickly visualize duplicated or broken scrobbles.

### Use the default (english) version of lastfm. Otherwise things go haywire.

- [ ] todo: process dates based on language set
- [ ] todo: same visualization on TopTracks 
  (some scrobblers sometimes store different artist / album names)


### Had the misfortune of losing my script, originally written only in the tampermonkey editor
I managed to recover it thanks to https://gist.github.com/derjanb/9f6c10168e63c3dc3cf0
The python script is included in the repo as tampermonkey_recover.py
